# Radiosity, the realistic rendering approach
  - Algorithms are based on 
    - [Modeling the Interaction of Light Between Diffuse Surfaces](http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~cutler/classes/advancedgraphics/S07/lectures/goral.pdf)
    - [The Hemi-Cube, A Radiosity solution for complex enviroments](http://artis.imag.fr/~Cyril.Soler/DEA/IlluminationGlobale/Papers/p31-cohen.pdf)

   - Multi-steps rendering, by Radiosity and Ray-tracing
